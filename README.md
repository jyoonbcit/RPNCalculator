# RPNCalculator
This was an assignment at BCIT to create a Reverse Polish Notation calculator.<br>
Everything was programmed by me except for the main function in RPNCalculator.java.<br>
To run it, set some input parameters in the run configurations for RPNCalculator.java.<br>
Example input: 10 "1 2 +"
